create_dataset_webcam.py uses the webcam to capture faces and create the dataset.

create_dataset_comp.py takes images from the specified directory and can also be used to create the dataset.

model_creation_ResNet50.ipynb uses the pre-trained ResNet50 model to train on the data. After training the model is saved
for testing and comparison.

model_creation_VGG16.ipynb uses the pre-trained VGG16 model to train on the data. After training the model is saved for 
testing and comparison.

model_creation_VGG19.ipynb uses the pre-trained VGG19 model to train on the data. After training the model is saved for 
testing and comparison.

best_model.ipynb is used to test the accuracy of the three models and chose the best one out of them which is used for the 
image classification task from videos.

frontend_application_opencv.py takes the best model out of the three and use it to classify a face from the video of a 
laptop webcam. It detects face from a video and classifies whose face it is.
